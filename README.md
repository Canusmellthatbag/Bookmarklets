# How to use:
Copy and paste the JavaScript into a new bookmark at the same place where the URL normally goes. Don't forget to give the bookmark a name so you can remember its function. After saving you can click the bookmark to activate the script. 

Please note that for a lot of bookmarklets to work, ***pop-ups*** need to be ***enabled*** in the ***settings*** of the browser. Also, do not execute a bookmarklet from the blank or starting page of a browser, but go to an online website first.

### Censys bookmarklets
When you encounter an Analytics code in the source code of a webpage during your investigations, you can click the bookmarklet. Enter the Analytics number in the pop-up screen and press *Enter*. The search will then be executed in search.censys.io. 

### EmailFinder bookmarklets
If you want to search for (hidden) e-mailadresses in the text or source code of a webpage, click this bookmarklet. If there are e-mail addresses present, it will return them in a new window. Otherwise a pop-up will state that nothing has been found. 

### WhatsMyName bookmarklet
Click the bookmarklet to enter a username to search for on WhatsMyName.app. Press *enter* and a new tab will open where the search will begin on the site. Happy OSINTing!

Please use these scripts in a professional manner.
