# K2SOsint-Bookmarklets
A small collection of bookmarklets that are useful for OSINT.

Copy and paste the source code (click on the file to see it) into a bookmark and click the bookmark to activate it. Please note that for a lot of bookmarklets to work, pop-ups need to be enabled in the settings of the browser. Also, do not execute a bookmarklet from the blank or starting page of a browser, but go to an online website first.

Please use these scripts in a professional manner.
